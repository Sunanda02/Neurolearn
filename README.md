# NeuroLearn - Adaptive Learning Platform

NeuroLearn is an adaptive learning platform with a Next.js frontend and a
FastAPI backend. It combines course discovery, video learning, transcription,
question generation, attention monitoring, adaptive assessment, gamification,
and report generation into one full-stack learning workflow.

## Features

- Course dashboard, learning sessions, assessments, results, profile, and leaderboard views
- Authentication flows for signup, login, password reset, and current-user state
- Auto course discovery from topic input using scraping and metadata fallbacks
- Multi-source video learning with YouTube, MP4, and URL support
- Webcam attention monitoring with MediaPipe-backed scoring when ML dependencies are installed
- Whisper transcription and FLAN-T5 question generation with dummy fallbacks for local demos
- Cognitive Readiness Score (CRS) for adaptive difficulty selection
- XP, streaks, badges, challenges, notifications, and leaderboard endpoints
- PDF report generation and optional email delivery
- Frontend fallback data mode when the backend is unavailable

### Flowchart

<p align="center">
  <img src="flow_diagram.png" width="800">
</p>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9 or newer
- Python 3.10 or newer
- PostgreSQL running locally or a reachable PostgreSQL connection string
- Optional: a webcam for live attention monitoring
- Optional: FFmpeg for Whisper/video processing workflows

## Quick Start: Frontend Demo

The frontend can run by itself. If the backend is not available, it uses local
fallback data unless strict API mode is enabled.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
copy .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Frontend environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STRICT=false
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STRICT=true` when you want backend connection failures to
surface immediately instead of falling back to demo data.

## Quick Start: Full Stack

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python main.py
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8000`.

- Swagger docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- API overview: `http://localhost:8000/api`

On macOS/Linux, activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
copy .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend Configuration

The backend reads configuration from `backend/.env`.

Common local variables:

```env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
DEBUG=true
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000

PG_HOST=localhost
PG_PORT=5432
PG_DB=neurolearn
PG_USER=neurolearn
PG_PASSWORD=neurolearn_dev_pw

JWT_SECRET=change-this-for-local-dev
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=base
FLAN_T5_MODEL=google/flan-t5-base

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_FROM_NAME=NeuroLearn
```

You can also provide a full SQLAlchemy URL:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/neurolearn
```

The application creates database tables on startup through SQLAlchemy. Alembic
configuration is also present under `backend/migrations`.

## Optional ML Setup

`backend/requirements.txt` installs the full ML stack. Some packages are large,
especially PyTorch, Whisper, Transformers, MediaPipe, and OpenCV.

After installing Playwright, install Chromium for the content-discovery scraper:

```bash
cd backend
python -m playwright install chromium
```

When ML models are unavailable, the backend keeps the JSON contract stable by
returning realistic fallback data for supported features.

## Video URL Support

The video player auto-detects and handles:

| URL Type | Example | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Direct MP4 | `https://example.com/video.mp4` | Native video element |
| YouTube | `youtube.com/watch?v=...` or `youtu.be/...` | Embedded iframe |
| Other URLs | External video pages | iframe fallback where allowed |

Use the custom URL option on the video page to paste a video link directly.

## Learning Flow

### Video Learning Session

```text
Student opens /video?course=course_001

1. Frontend fetches course content from GET /api/courses/{course_id}.
2. Student plays a selected video.
3. If the student grants consent, CameraFeed sends frames to POST /api/attention/snapshot.
4. Backend analyzes the frame with MediaPipe when available and returns an attention score.
5. TranscriptionPanel reads transcript segments from GET /api/transcription/{video_id}/live.
6. When the video ends, the assessment path opens for that course/video context.
```

### Assessment Flow

```text
Student opens /assessment

1. Frontend requests questions from POST /api/assessment/generate.
2. Backend chooses difficulty and generates or returns questions.
3. Student submits answers to POST /api/assessment/submit.
4. Backend grades the attempt, computes CRS, persists results, awards XP, and returns feedback.
5. Frontend shows score, XP, adaptive recommendations, and CRS breakdown on /results.
```

## Cognitive Readiness Score

CRS is the adaptive scoring layer used by the assessment engine. It combines:

- Performance: recent assessment score history
- Attention: gaze, head pose, and blink-normality signals
- Response integrity: timing behavior independent of correctness
- Learning trend: slope over recent scores
- Content complexity: transcript readability and technical density

The fused CRS value selects the next difficulty tier and is persisted so later
submissions can use the learner's recent history.

Default difficulty thresholds:

```text
CRS > 0.75          hard
0.45 <= CRS <= 0.75 medium
CRS < 0.45          easy
```

The CRS configuration lives in `backend/config/CRS_config.py`.

## Testing And Validation

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

Focused CRS tests:

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_CRS.py -v
```
