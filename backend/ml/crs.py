Cognitive Readiness Score (CRS) — Phase 2 of the implementation spec.

FIXES CR1 (peer review packet): the decision logic previously lived in
adaptive_engine.py as a rule cascade (score baseline +/-1 integer
modifiers, clamped to 3 tiers) — there was no normalized [0,1] readiness
value and no weights alpha..epsilon anywhere in code, despite both
appearing in the paper's Eq. (1), Fig. 2, and Table II.

    CRS = alpha*P + beta*A + gamma*I + delta*T + epsilon*C

This module is the single place that combines the five component modules
(performance, attention_subscores, response_integrity, trend,
content_complexity) into one CRS value, a difficulty recommendation, and a
human-readable explanation — exactly the three things Phase 2 specifies
`compute_crs()` must return, plus the component breakdown.

    Compute the Cognitive Readiness Score and a difficulty recommendation.

    All arguments are optional and independently defaultable, because CRS
    must be computable at different points in the student workflow (e.g.
    `get_initial_difficulty` has no `time_spent`/`time_limit`/`was_correct`
    yet, since the assessment hasn't started). Each missing input falls
    back to its component module's documented neutral default rather than
    silently being treated as zero — see PerformanceConfig.default_score_pct,
    IntegrityConfig.min_integrity is NOT used as a "missing" default (a
    truly missing timing pair returns a neutral 1.0 from the thoughtful-pace
    branch's logic only when explicitly given a neutral ratio; here we
    short-circuit to 0.5 directly — see below) and ComplexityConfig
    .default_complexity.

    Args:
        recent_scores_pct: history for both Performance (P) and Trend (T).
        attention_score_pct: 0-100 average behavioral-cue score for the session.
        time_spent / time_limit: seconds, for Response Integrity (I).
        was_correct: correctness of the most recent response (explanation
            text only for I — see response_integrity.py docstring).
        transcript_text: transcript of content viewed, for Complexity (C).
        config: CRSConfig (weights, thresholds, sub-configs).

    Returns:
        CRSResult — crs in [0,1], difficulty tier, component breakdown,
        weights actually used, and a human-readable explanation string.
