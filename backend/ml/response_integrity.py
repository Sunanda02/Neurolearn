backend/ml/response_integrity.py

Response Integrity (I) component of the Cognitive Readiness Score.

FIXES CR3 (peer review packet): the legacy rule in adaptive_engine.py only
fired when `time_ratio < 0.3 AND current_score < 70` — i.e. it could only
ever flag "fast + wrong", and the paper's own Introduction motivates this
component with the opposite, harder case: a learner who answers correctly
while rapid completion quickly. A rule gated on low score structurally cannot catch
that case. This module computes integrity from timing ALONE, independent
of correctness, exactly as Phase 5 specifies:

    Fast            -> penalty (regardless of whether the answer was right)
    Thoughtful pace -> maximum score
    Very slow       -> penalty

Correctness still matters for CRS overall (that's what the Performance
component P is for) — but it must not be the gate that decides whether
timing-based rapid completion is even checked.
