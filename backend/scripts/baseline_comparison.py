baseline_comparison.py — regenerates the CRS-driven vs. accuracy-only
Baseline Comparison table (§5.2 of the manuscript revision package)
directly from the shipped ml/adaptive_engine.py. Compares the preserved
legacy rule cascade (_determine_difficulty_legacy) against the new
CRS-driven path (determine_difficulty) on identical inputs.

Run from backend/ (note: requires backend/ on PYTHONPATH):
