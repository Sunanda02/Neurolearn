backend/config/crs_config.py

Central, externalized configuration for the Cognitive Readiness Score (CRS)
and the modules that feed it. Nothing in ml/crs.py or its component modules
should hardcode a weight, threshold, or window size — it should be read from
here, so the values can later become trainable / tunable without touching
module code.

This addresses CR1 from the peer-review packet directly: the paper's
Eq. (1) weights (alpha..epsilon) must exist somewhere as actual numbers,
not just as symbols in the manuscript.
