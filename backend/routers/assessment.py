"""Assessment orchestration for the fixed mixed-method research protocol.

One study session produces one 10-item assessment: a single MCRF decision
(from the learner's MCRF/CRS state for the completed study session as a
whole) sets ONE difficulty for all of questions 1--5; a single LEGACY
decision (from the learner's durable historical performance) sets ONE
difficulty for all of questions 6--10. Both decisions are made up front, at
/generate time, before any question is generated or shown — never
recomputed from an in-assessment answer. This is protocol-level, not
item-level, adaptivity: a question's correctness, response time, or outcome
is used only for scoring/research logging and never changes the difficulty
of any question, including subsequent ones in the same block.

All ten questions are generated and persisted at /generate time, before Q1
is ever presented to the student. /answer therefore never generates a
question — it only validates the current question, records the answer,
computes scoring/research response information, and returns the
already-existing next question. The engines themselves remain in
:mod:`ml.adaptive_engine`; this router owns only their protocol, evidence
flow, and durable study logging.
