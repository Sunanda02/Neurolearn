    thread, the same way run_in_threadpool does, but with `cancellable=True`.

    FIX (shutdown hang): run_in_threadpool's default (`cancellable=False`)
    means that if the request's asyncio task is cancelled — e.g. uvicorn
    cancelling in-flight request tasks on shutdown — the `await` still
    blocks until the worker thread finishes, no matter how long that takes.
    For a multi-minute Whisper job, that's exactly what produced the
    Ctrl+C hang ("Waiting for connections to close." / "ASGI 'lifespan'
    protocol appears unsupported."), since the server could never actually
    finish shutting down while this request stayed in flight.
    `cancellable=True` lets the `await` return immediately on cancellation
    instead, so the request task — and therefore the server shutdown — is
    no longer blocked. The worker thread itself is a daemon thread and
    keeps running the yt-dlp/FFmpeg/Whisper job independently in the
    background (its eventual result is simply not awaited anymore); it
    still populates the existing in-memory transcript cache and releases
    the existing per-video lock exactly as before, so normal (non-shutdown)
    behavior — including per-video locking and CUDA/CPU handling inside
    the model — is completely unchanged.
